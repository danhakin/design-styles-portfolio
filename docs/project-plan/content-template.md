# UI Design Styles Portfolio - Content Template

This document provides consistent content templates for each section of the UI Design Styles Portfolio. Using the same content across all style implementations will help highlight the visual differences between styles.

## Fictional Product: DesignSync

All implementations will showcase a fictional design collaboration tool called "DesignSync" that helps teams work together on design projects. This provides real-world context while keeping the focus on visual design differences.

## States to Demonstrate

For interactive components, implement these states with the same content:

1. **Default state**
2. **Hover state**
3. **Active/pressed state**
4. **Focus state**
5. **Disabled state**
6. **Loading state**
7. **Error state**
8. **Success state**

## Placeholder Content Dimensions

When implementing each style, use these consistent dimensions for placeholder content:

- Hero Image: 600×400px
- Feature Icons: 48×48px
- Card Images: 300×200px
- Avatar Images: 40×40px

This consistency will ensure that the focus remains on the differences in design style rather than content.
